# Bootstrap plugin for Web Schema Forms

This plugin enhanced Web Schema Forms with the classes required for Bootstrap.

## Hints

The following hints are supported:

* ```bootstrap_type```. Can be set to ```basic``` (the default), ```inline```, or ```horizontal```.
  This basically configures the type of form you want, causing the full template to behave
  accordingly.
